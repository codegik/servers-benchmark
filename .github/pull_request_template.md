# Servers Benchmark Pull Request
### PR Requirements

Please make sure your server port matches the script port matches the simulation and make sure you run in the browser. I will run in a Ubuntu 22.02 so it need to work on Linux. 

Mark this boxes with X if you did it right, otherwise go fix your pr!

PR Checklist:
- [ ] 0. Did you run on Linux? Did you run Gatling? 
- [ ] 1. Create a Gatling simulation
- [ ] 2. Create a Gatling script (chmod +x pls) add the tuning for linux os pls 
- [ ] 3. Create a run.sh script - add the tuning for linux os pls (chmod +x pls)
- [ ] 4. Add a different script to install dependencies(install-deps.sh)
